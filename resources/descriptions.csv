Its combined gas and electric range is 530mi.- always extra clear interior. This is one of our personal cars, we treat it with care. Each and every time!- silent electric drives on short trips (26mi). With level 2 charging it can charge back to 100% in 2h30m. It also comes with a home charging cable, so you can charge it overnight.- built in fuel efficiency and sport modes. The choice is yours: be balanced and fuel efficient or be nimble and sporty.- unbelievable inner space for its style. It's technically a hatchback, but really it has the inner space of a cross-over SUV. Very much on par with a Nissan Kicks or similar. With 2 bulky child seats and 2 adults over 6' in our family, you can trust us: it's more than enough legroom everywhere. It has even more legroom in the back than our Mazda CX-5 has.- multi-functional: great choice to pick this car for a weekend getaway with a family of 4 or a business trip.Delivery: we are very flexible with delivering the car to you, whether it's to your location, Lambert International Airport, or Union Station.Some great destinations to go for with this car in the region:- St Louis: Gateway Arch, Zoo, Acquarium, Forest Park, Creve Coeur Lake, Katy Trail, Castlewood State Park, Love Elk Park. - Near STL: Elephant Rocks State Park, Alton, Pete Marquette State Park, St Charles Main Street. - One / two day trips: Kansas City, Columbia, Chicago, Ozarks, Osage Beach, Branson, Memphis, Nashville.Efficient and Engaging PowertrainThe Niro PHEV pairs an all-aluminum, efficient 1.6-liter GDI (gasoline direct injection) four-cylinder engine with an 8.9 kWh (59 kW) lithium-polymer battery pack and a powerful 60-HP (44.5 kW) electric motor, a set-up for optimum fuel efficiency and electrically driven range. While the Niro PHEV boasts an MPGe rating of 105, its EPA-estimated MPG ratings of 48 mpg city, 44 mpg highway and 46 mpg/combined are similar to those of Niro hybrid. The estimated driving range when both electric and gasoline systems work together is up to 560 miles.Increased high-voltage battery capacity (+7.34 kWh more than Niro hybrid) and output/power have helped make the Niro Plug-in Hybrid an efficient, low emissions crossover with a 105 MPGe rating. The Niro PHEV’s compact, high voltage battery is neatly tucked under the cargo floor and under the rear seat and maintains the same spacious cargo capacity as the Niro hybrid. A single charging port is located in the driver’s side front fender. A full charge can be achieved in approximately 2.5 hours via a 240V (Level 2) charger, and under 9 hours via a 120V (Level 1) charger.The Niro PHEV employs the same six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) as the Niro, which translates to more enjoyable and engaging driving. Drivers can choose from several driving modes, including EV mode, Hybrid mode, (default) Eco mode, or Sport mode for quicker transmission response that takes advantage of the powertrain’s combined output of 139 horsepower and 195 lb.-ft. of torque.Another notable energy-conserving feature is the Driver-Only Air Conditioning, which directs the ventilation toward the driver only and decreases the power consumption of the air conditioning system.Strong and Light CoreThe lightweight structure underpinning the Niro Plug-in Hybrid is built on the same dedicated platform as the conventional Niro, utilizing over 50 percent Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). Extensive use of hot-stamped steel components and industrial joint adhesive aims to increase torsional rigidity and improve structural integrity. Kia is targeting the Niro and Niro PHEV to earn top honors from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS).Weight reduction was a critical aspect of developing the Niro PHEV, so in addition to the body, AHSS was also used to engineer other elements including lightweight seat frames. Engineers were also able to reduce overall weight by using aluminum for the hood, tailgate and several suspension elements including the front lower control arms, front and rear knuckles, and in the brake calipers.Feature-RichLike the Niro hybrid, the Niro PHEV seats five and offers the same great crossover functionality and generous cargo capacity. The Niro PHEV will be offered in three trim levels—LX, EX and EX Premium. Our car is the EX Premium. Top of the line. In addition, the Niro PHEV is offered with a suite of advanced driver assistance and convenience technologies, including Blind Spot Detection (BSD) with Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA), Lane Change Assist (LCA), and front and rear parking sensors; while Smart Cruise Control (SCC); Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB); Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Keep Assist System (LKAS) are all standard.The Niro Plug-in Hybrid also includes UVO eco which extends Kia’s award-winning connectivity service by offering convenience and safety features tailored to eco-minded drivers. With UVO eco, drivers can remotely monitor and charge their vehicle’s high-voltage battery; setup charging schedules to take advantage of off-peak utility rates; preset the vehicle’s cabin temperature, turn on window defrosters, and heat the steering wheel, lock or unlock doors, and find their vehicle from their smartphone or web enabled device.""

While the Niro PHEV boasts an MPGe rating of 105, its EPA-estimated MPG ratings of 48 mpg city, 44 mpg highway and 46 mpg/combined are similar to those of Niro hybrid. The estimated driving range when both electric and gasoline systems work together is up to 560 miles.Increased high-voltage battery capacity (+7.34 kWh more than Niro hybrid) and output/power have helped make the Niro Plug-in Hybrid an efficient, low emissions crossover with a 105 MPGe rating. The Niro PHEV’s compact, high voltage battery is neatly tucked under the cargo floor and under the rear seat and maintains the same spacious cargo capacity as the Niro hybrid. A single charging port is located in the driver’s side front fender. A full charge can be achieved in approximately 2.5 hours via a 240V (Level 2) charger, and under 9 hours via a 120V (Level 1) charger.The Niro PHEV employs the same six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) as the Niro, which translates to more enjoyable and engaging driving. Drivers can choose from several driving modes, including EV mode, Hybrid mode, (default) Eco mode, or Sport mode for quicker transmission response that takes advantage of the powertrain’s combined output of 139 horsepower and 195 lb.-ft. of torque.Another notable energy-conserving feature is the Driver-Only Air Conditioning, which directs the ventilation toward the driver only and decreases the power consumption of the air conditioning system.Strong and Light CoreThe lightweight structure underpinning the Niro Plug-in Hybrid is built on the same dedicated platform as the conventional Niro, utilizing over 50 percent Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). Extensive use of hot-stamped steel components and industrial joint adhesive aims to increase torsional rigidity and improve structural integrity. Kia is targeting the Niro and Niro PHEV to earn top honors from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS).Weight reduction was a critical aspect of developing the Niro PHEV, so in addition to the body, AHSS was also used to engineer other elements including lightweight seat frames. Engineers were also able to reduce overall weight by using aluminum for the hood, tailgate and several suspension elements including the front lower control arms, front and rear knuckles, and in the brake calipers.Feature-RichLike the Niro hybrid, the Niro PHEV seats five and offers the same great crossover functionality and generous cargo capacity. The Niro PHEV will be offered in three trim levels—LX, EX and EX Premium. Our car is the EX Premium. Top of the line. In addition, the Niro PHEV is offered with a suite of advanced driver assistance and convenience technologies, including Blind Spot Detection (BSD) with Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA), Lane Change Assist (LCA), and front and rear parking sensors; while Smart Cruise Control (SCC); Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB); Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Keep Assist System (LKAS) are all standard.The Niro Plug-in Hybrid also includes UVO eco which extends Kia’s award-winning connectivity service by offering convenience and safety features tailored to eco-minded drivers. With UVO eco, drivers can remotely monitor and charge their vehicle’s high-voltage battery; setup charging schedules to take advantage of off-peak utility rates; preset the vehicle’s cabin temperature, turn on window defrosters, and heat the steering wheel, lock or unlock doors, and find their vehicle from their smartphone or web enabled device.""

A second row with luxurious appointments and a driver's seat that will have you coming up with new reasons to drive somewhere.This Platinum trim is simply amazing. Not only do all the materials look and feel great, but all buttons and dials are in easy rach and make sense. In the middle is a large touchscreen running Ford's Sync 3 system. This gives you access to XM Satellite Radio, navigation and mobile integration with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.Speaking of advanced safety systems, this Platinum is loaded with the latest, including active park assist, adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation, a 360-camera view with parking sonars, blind spot monitoring and more.Drive modes help tune the vehicle to specific conditions. Even switching the transmission into four-low is a push-button affair.Even though the Expedition Max is a big vehicle, it's suprisingly easy to drive on the road.

Sorry, no smoking allowed.If you have a big family, or a big job, you need something bigger than a standard three row crossover. This is the Ford Expedition MAX, it's a big SUV that's also big on features and we have a complete look, right now.Introduced as all-new in 2020, this new Ford Expedition has been so well received, it may soon overtake the long-time sales leader, the Chevy Tahoe. What has people so excited about this full-size SUV? A combination of price and features you just wont find anywhere else. The fact that it looks great too, is just icing on the cake.The model we're looking at here is the Expedition MAX Platinum, which features a longer wheel base a wealth of features; including advanced safety tech, leather-trimmed seats, power… everything and more. The expedition starts at close to $50,000.

Fold the seats up and you get a third row that isn't a penalty box. A second row with luxurious appointments and a driver's seat that will have you coming up with new reasons to drive somewhere.This Platinum trim is simply amazing.

I have approximately 55 different vehicles to choose from and over 2450 completed trips.  Click on my profile to see them all!This is a great new Santa Fe that has under 5000 miles on it.  The all-wheel drive makes it perfect for heading up to the mountains for a weekend getaway or even weeklong trip.  It's also great for driving along the front range and in the city.  Give it a try!***Contactless Check-In/Check Out and Parking Fee*** We often do contactless check-in/out where you access the vehicle through a lock box.  When you return the vehicle, you will need to pay between $6.35 and $8.35 through the ParkMan App for the first 24 hours of lot parking.  Please DO NOT book this vehicle if you are not ok with this small parking fee!***Getting Downtown is EASY*** It's not really any harder to get here to get a vehicle (via Uber/Lyft or the A-Line train) than to deal with the rental car shuttle and the lines there.  The rental car lots are about 15 minutes away from the airport terminal via shuttle, sometimes with multiple stops, as well as the wait to get the shuttle and the wait to get the car.  Also, downtown is more or less on the way to the mountains, if that's where you're headed.*A-line train* The A-line train costs $10.50 per person (with discounts for some people) and leaves right from an area not far from baggage claim.  It runs every 15 minutes during the day and takes 37-44 minutes to get to Union Station, the last stop.It is pretty easy to get to the key pick-up location from Union Station - you can take the free 16th Street Shuttle to Champa and walk 7 blocks to the key location, or you could grab a quick Uber/Lyft from Union Station to the key location. There's also the option of sending the primary driver ahead (either on the prior train or once you get to Union Station, and then having the primary driver go back for the others). ***(Optional) Photo Request***:  If you go to any really cool locations, we’d love for you to share with us a photo of the vehicle in that location.  We’d like to use these to augment some of our pictures of the vehicles in the listing!""   "

Please DO NOT book this vehicle if you are not ok with this small parking fee!***Getting Downtown is EASY*** It's not really any harder to get here to get a vehicle (via Uber/Lyft or the A-Line train) than to deal with the rental car shuttle and the lines there.  The rental car lots are about 15 minutes away from the airport terminal via shuttle, sometimes with multiple stops, as well as the wait to get the shuttle and the wait to get the car.  Also, downtown is more or less on the way to the mountains, if that's where you're headed.*A-line train* The A-line train costs $10.50 per person (with discounts for some people) and leaves right from an area not far from baggage claim.  It runs every 15 minutes during the day and takes 37-44 minutes to get to Union Station, the last stop.It is pretty easy to get to the key pick-up location from Union Station - you can take the free 16th Street Shuttle to Champa and walk 7 blocks to the key location, or you could grab a quick Uber/Lyft from Union Station to the key location. There's also the option of sending the primary driver ahead (either on the prior train or once you get to Union Station, and then having the primary driver go back for the others). ***(Optional) Photo Request***:  If you go to any really cool locations, we’d love for you to share with us a photo of the vehicle in that location.

Some of the model names have changed, and new features are available that were not before, including a navigation system, rearview monitor, a USB port, and 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.The 2011 Rogue gets fresh styling with a new front fascia and grille, new front and rear spoilers, new trim accents. Rogue's exterior is designed to present an image of modern sophistication. Its dramatic styling includes dynamically arched forms and powerful rear shoulder lines. The extensive redesign for 2011 adds to its sporty feel, while enhancing its upscale appearance.Interior changes for 2011 include a new instrument panel design and a new center cluster. Rogue's interior is designed to satisfy both the functional needs of the buyers and their emotional needs, including the versatility provided by a large 58 cubic feet of cargo space. Leather-appointed seating surfaces are available along with a six-way power driver's seat and a 60/40 split folding rear bench seat. We found the cabin pleasant, with materials that would look good in higher-priced vehicles. In addition to the navigation system and rearview monitor, the Rogue is available with Nissan Intelligent Key, Bluetooth, XM Satellite Radio and a powerful Bose-developed audio system with seven speakers with woofer, AUX input and MP3 playback. The controls are easy to use and understand.The Rogue seats five. There is no third row available for seven-passenger seating. The Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV. Based on a car platform, it's considered a crossover vehicle, like the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, and Chevy Equinox. Utility is enhanced by numerous convenient storage and ultra-functionality features, including an oversized glove compartment, a large center console and a washable, removable tray that fits below the cargo area floor to hold wet or dirty gear and tools. The driver gets a variety of cupholders, a memo/pen holder, coin holder and cell phone/sunglasses holders.In back, the Rogue offers good cargo utility. The rear seats fold flat and an available folding front passenger seat allows ladders and other long items to be loaded.All Rogue models have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower mated to a continuously variable transmission. No V6 is available. We found the four-cylinder engine works well with the CVT to provide decent performance and frugal fuel economy.All-wheel drive is available for snow and rain. The Rogue is meant as a daily commuter and weekend runabout, not an off-road adventure vehicle. Towing capacity is just 1,500 pounds.Behind the wheel, the Rogue offers carlike ride and handling. We think it's one of the better handling small SUVs, though we would not call it sporty. The ride allows for a lot of road feel and can become harsh on rough and irregular surfaces. Road imperfections and engine sounds intrude into the cabin.""   "
