** Avoid the 10% Turo Airport Fee, of your total booking, by choosing the Home Location for FREE, DIA delivery! **

With Turo‚Äôs Policy changes as of 06/02/2022, there is no longer free parking for Turo vehicles in the airport parking lots. The guest will now be responsible for parking costs upon exiting the lot, and the host is responsible for paying for parking after you drop the vehicle off. 

Home Location (6 minutes from airport by
free shuttle, on airport property): Due to my free delivery and parking costs in order to make pick up a breeze for you, the only fee you‚Äôll have to pay is leaving the lot. That can be up to $24, however, most of the time it‚Äôs not that much. You won‚Äôt be responsible to pay for any parking once you drop the vehicle off, as I will cover any parking costs that take place upon completion of your reservation. 

Make sure you register anyone else who wants to drive it with Turo. Otherwise, you have no insurance!

I know you aren't renting this Jeep just to get from one place to another. You are renting this car for the ""experience"".  I am committed to making sure you have a great experience.

Harvey is the perfect car to take around the island, he's big enough to fit all your beach or hiking needs while small enough to maneuver around down town and small parking lots.

To maintain the cleanliness and integrity of Harvey, we ask our guests to keep the sand at the beach, throw out all food and drinks in a timely manner, and take out any wet towels or clothes. No smoking, or off roading is permitted! After each trip, we take Harvey to professional cleaners to make sure he's in perfect condition for our next guests.

We also have extra packages such as a Beach Kit with an additional charge that includes 2 Beach Chairs, a Beach Umbrella, and 2 Beach Towels! Our Large BackPack Cooler is also very convenient for those long beach days. We hope to create more diverse kits in the future if there is a demand for them. Anything that breaks during a trip must be replaced by our guest or at least paid for.

Turo adds their own 10% fee for this option, and you will have to pay up to $30 in parking fees when leaving the airport, and when returning the car. 

Most hosts park in a cheap ""shuttle lot"" a few miles from the airport, forcing you to spend an hour just to get to their car. We park in the garage attached to the terminal. It's MUCH quicker and easier for you, and more secure for us. 

For a cheaper option, choose pickup. This is set to my home address and is only 15 minutes from the airport.***

***BOOKING***
The times for pickup and return default to 10am. Please adjust these times for when you actually need the vehicle. A good rule of thumb is book 1 hour after your flight arrives and 2 hours before your flight departs. (Your flight ticket already accounts for any time changes, so don't adjust for that.)
Late pickups/dropoffs without communication will result in trip cancellation/late return fees. Early pickups are absolutely not allowed UNLESS you request the change in the Turo app. Communication is essential to ensure your trip goes as smooth as possible.

***VEHICLE CLEANING***
Please empty the vehicle of any trash you accumulate during your trip. Excessive dirtiness will result in a cleaning fee. Please do NOT run the vehicle through the car wash. 

***REFUELING***
-Please use only 91 octane gas and return the vehicle with the same level of fuel as you received it.

***Contactless Check-In/Check Out and Parking Fee*** 

We often do contactless check-in/out where you access the vehicle through a lock box.  When you return the vehicle, you will need to pay between $6.35 and $8.35 through the ParkMan App for the first 24 hours of lot parking.  Please DO NOT book this vehicle if you are not ok with this small parking fee!

***Getting Downtown is EASY*** It's not really any harder to get here to get a vehicle (via Uber/Lyft or the A-Line train) than to deal with the rental car shuttle and the lines there.  The rental car lots are about 15 minutes away from the airport terminal via shuttle, sometimes with multiple stops, as well as the wait to get the shuttle and the wait to get the car.  Also, downtown is more or less on the way to the mountains, if that's where you're headed.

*A-line train* 

The A-line train costs $10.50 per person (with discounts for some people) and leaves right from an area not far from baggage claim.  It runs every 15 minutes during the day and takes 37-44 minutes to get to Union Station, the last stop.

It is pretty easy to get to the key pick-up location from Union Station - you can take the free 16th Street Shuttle to Champa and walk 7 blocks to the key location, or you could grab a quick Uber/Lyft from Union Station to the key location. There's also the option of sending the primary driver ahead (either on the prior train or once you get to Union Station, and then having the primary driver go back for the others).

completely full. Please return completely full. 

Upload a picture of the gas receipt in the ""trip
pictures "". OR keep all the gas receipts in car Center Console. If not I can go fill it up for you for
$10 plus the cost of gas.

Dogs are great! but if they shed, drool, or
peed, clean it up or be subjected to a $150
cleaning fee.

Don't smoke ever. Cigarettes, pot, or hashish.

We can tell, it won't disapate and you'll be
subjected up to a $250 cleaning fee to get
rid of the smell.

The car will no take off (OR STOP) like your
sports car. Drive it like you grandmother in
the passenger seat.

Other than that have fun and enjoy the ride.

Keep in mind this is not a basic F-150. Turo doesn‚Äôt let us differentiate for this particular model unfortunately. 

This 802A (highest trim package available) 5 seater offers an amazing time in the city, in the mountains, and in the snow, all while keeping you safe with the latest safety technology.

The truck has a throaty twin turbocharged V6 putting out a crazy 450 hp and 510 lb-ft of torque that will make you glad you chose the Raptor over any other F-150 sub-tier models. This power is then transferred through a ten-speed, automatic transmission.

As much power as this truck has, it drives very comfortably and smooth and still feels like a luxury ride. 

!!!Please keep in mind that we do not allow off-road use. Trips to ski resorts are welcomed. This truck is too wide for most mountain trails and is not to be used for any type of rock crawling or Baja. Basic canyon drives are allowed.

Aesthetically the cars have some scratches and small details. It is a car with 5 years of use and is priced much cheaper than cars from large rental companies.

If you agree to rent my car, I guarantee that it will be delivered clean, sanitized and in perfect conditions for use, so you can spend your holidays with peace of mind. If you don't worry about some scratches, my cars are the best value for money!

ABOUT PICK UP

If you want to pick up your car from the airport parking lot, please go to your reservation menu and change it to MCO Aeroporto. The cost is $120.00 and the cost of parking is included.
The car will be dropped off at Level 3, row H. I will send a photo of the exact location to your cell phone.

If you choose to pick up the car at the airport, the rules are as follows:

ARRIVING MCO:
The car should always be picked up and returned to
Terminal A,
Level 3,
Row H.
As soon as you pick up your bags, look for the elevator that is in front of the escalator.
In this elevator you go to the ""Tunnel"" level. If you have any questions ask an airport employee how you can go to the tunnel that goes to the parking lot.
Cross the tunnel and take the elevator at the end of the tunnel.
Press the ""Parking level 3"" button
Find row H and get in the car.
The key will always be on top of the front tire on the driver's side.
Don't forget that the car will be at TERMINAL A.

DEPARTING MCO
Getting close to the airport you need to follow the orange signs written ""terminal A"". Before arriving at Departures, on your left, there is the entrance to the parking lot. Enter and park at Level 3, Row H and leave the key on top of the front tire and parking ticket on the car console. You can also use the E-pass Sticker to enter the parking lot.

This VW ID.4 Pro S AWD features 5 seats, 240 miles of EPA-rated range, and access to the greatest number of Fast Charging stations in Colorado due to its use of the CCS industry standard charging port through Electrify America, ChargePoint, and EVGo. While driving an EV does take a little more planning than in a gas car, it is totally worth it.

This ID.4 has 5 seats, VW's advanced driving aids, and black exterior/interior. 

Please reach out if you have any questions about this vehicle, EVs in general, EV charging, or visiting Colorado. We're happy to help!

Do not ever let the vehicle's state of charge drop below 30 miles. The vehicle uses battery power even when idle (like when it is parked overnight). For lists and maps of chargers, please visit electrifyamerica.com, plugshare.com, and https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/zero-emission-vehicles/ev-fast-charging-corridors.

Finally, absolutely no smoking anything or vaping in or near the vehicle!

This is essentially an SUV version of the Tesla Model 3 with similar styling inside and out, engaging performance, and excellent range. The significant differences are a standard dual-motor, AWD configuration, a roomier interior, and optional 3-row seating in the Model Y.

The Model Y has the engaging performance that‚Äôs become a hallmark of the Tesla brand. Its dual-motor electric drivetrain delivers instant torque to all four wheels resulting in quick acceleration with a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds in this Long Range model. 

The interior of the Tesla Model Y has a sleek and minimalist design. It uses premium vegan simulated leather materials and a tasteful piece of wood trim spanning the dashboard. The centerpiece of the interior is a 15-inch infotainment system that controls just about everything. It has a bit of a learning curve, and we wish it came with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

The styling of the Tesla Model Y is very similar to the Model 3 sedan but with an SUV body. It has sleek body lines, stylish wheel designs, and a sloping roofline. The Performance model has a sportier look with a lowered suspension, 21-inch wheels, and a carbon fiber rear spoiler.

1.  We must have a minimum of a 30 minute heads up via Turo messaging.
2.  IF you wish to leave your own car parked at the office complex while you use our car, you can do so but at your own risk.  The parking lot is safe but we cannot be responsible.

GUIDELINES - 

CARS IS NON-SMOKING PLEASEüôèüèª/ NON-VAPING / NON-WEED SMOKING (LICENSED OR NOT) AND PET FRIENDLY. IF ANY OF OUR CARS ARE RETURNED WITH SMOKE OR PET ODOR YOU WILL GET BILLED FOR A $50 CLEANING FEE (TO WIPE DOWN THE ENTIRE CAR), AND A $50 SMOKE FEE (TO OZONE THE SMELL OUT).  IF THE CAR IS RETURNED WITH AN AIR FRESHENER YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE $50 CLEANING AND $50 SMOKE FEES AUTOMATICALLY.  We would not want to have to charge you $100 or more, and we are absolutely sure you would not want to pay it either.  So please please please don‚Äôt smoke or bring pets into our cars for the sake of guests who are allergic to either one.

What if I am running late upon return?

It is hard to say because it depends how late you are and if there is another reservation for your car right after your return.  Generally we are flexible IF you are within the 24 hour period of your pick up time. If you know you are going to be late, then we expect you to request a time change so that we can plan our day accordingly.  IF you are more than 30 minutes late, Turo may exercise their Late Return Policy which means you will be charged an extra day, along with any additional late fees.  So please please please communicate with us and let us know your location and ETAs are as often as you can.  Communication is everything in this car sharing business!

Can I smoke cigarettes, weed, or vape in your car? 

üö≠ NO. Please be advised that we promote and provide non-smoking vehicles, therefore, ùòÄùó∫ùóºùó∏ùó∂ùóªùó¥ (whatever), vaping ùó∂ùòÄ ùóªùóºùòÅ ùóΩùó≤ùóøùó∫ùó∂ùòÅùòÅùó≤ùó± in any of our vehicles at any time. This is a firm restriction and you will incur a hefty fine if you do smoke / vape in our car. We have zero judgment if you smoke, but we also have zero tolerance if you do so in our car. Please respect that these are our personal vehicles and also our livelihood. We simply cannot rent out a vehicle that smells of smoke, and must take it offline for cleaning and ozone treatment. If you choose to ignore this, we will seek $ùü≠ùü±ùü¨ ùòÅùóº $ùüØùü¨ùü¨ ùó∂ùóª ùóøùó≤ùó∂ùó∫ùóØùòÇùóøùòÄùó≤ùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ, depending on severity. We thank you for not smoking in our cars!
Can I change my pick up and return times and or locations?

Yes you can.  All we ask is that you do so via the app.  Request your changes in time / location preference and if we can do it, we shall approve the request. 

Is the car equipped with a toll pass?

For your convenience, all of our vehicles are equipped with a SunPass so that you don't have to stop and pay along the way!  We will bill you for tolls and airport parking (if applicable) directly through an ‚ÄúIncidental Invoice‚Äù via the Turo app at the end of your trip.  Avoiding a toll road while in Orlando is practically impossible so if you are trying to maximize on your trip, by all means use the toll road!

Can I take your car out of State?

Our cars are not allowed to go out of state. You may make a request with us and we may approve you to go into GA/AL/SC/MI/TN but you would have to also Opt for the ‚ÄúUnlimited MIleage‚Äù options in extras.  If a guest does go out of state without our permission and or without opting for the Unlimited Mileage, it will result in a $100 per day surcharge. All of our vehicles are equipped with an insurance monitor and we will be alerted if it travels out of the state of Florida. Disconnecting the monitoring device will also result in a $100 surcharge, as we are charged by our insurance company when this occurs. Also note that if any breakdowns, or accidents happen the guest is completely financially responsible for getting the car towed back to Orlando at their own expense.

With gas prices today this is definitely a winner for your off the paved roads adventures! Heated seats, sun roof, Apple CarPlay, Weather-Tech Floor Liners, ALL Wheel Drive, Comfortable, #1 Safest Car on the Road, Keyless Start and Entry, Foldable seats for maximized space, and X-MODE!

Subaru's legendary all wheel drive system will get you out of dicey situations where other mortal vehicles would strand you, but X Mode works in addition to the all wheel drive system to give you even greater traction and control. 


X-Mode uses lower gear ratios to generate extra power at the wheels that have grip

X-Mode deactivates the transmission's lock-up clutch to better direct power to slipping wheels

X-Mode makes the traction control system extra sensitive so that it intervenes earlier during wheel slippage

X-Mode employs ""Hill Descent Control"" so you don't need to apply brakes and risk locking them up when headed down steep slopes.

Pressing the X-Mode switch activates 5 different forms of control to limit slipping tires:

1. Engine Throttle

In normal driving, when the driver steps on the accelerator pedal, the engine throttle opens up, however X-Mode is designed so that the throttle doesn't open too quickly. If the driver presses the accelerator further, the engine then delivers torque faster. X-Mode employs special settings that deliver torque gradually at first, but then makes it come on stronger.


2. Transmission

X-Mode keeps transmission in a lower gear so that engine power can be delivered stronger. This shifting pattern, while X-Mode is ON, lets the driver make the most of the power that is available.


3. All Wheel Drive

AWD control is improved by raising the front/rear coupling force when X-Mode is ON, which helps the driver drive power more evenly between the four wheels. This maximizes the traction of the tires.


4. Vehicle Dynamics Control System

The VDC system, when X-Mode is ON, includes a specially-tuned ""Enhanced LSD Control"". For example, if the left and right wheels are behaving differently, the system applies brakes only to wheels that are slipping. Compared to ordinary operation, the brakes are applied a lot earlier when X-Mode is ON, resulting in LSD control activating much faster.


5. Hill Descent Control

At low speeds (under 12 mph) Hill Descent Control helps maintain vehicle starting speed for safer maneuvering--the car itself manages the throttle and breaking allowing the driver to fully concentrate on steering.",SUV,152.0,2020.0,Crosstrek,FOUR_DOOR_SUV,24545.0,"COOLER,CAMERA,HAMMOCK,AIR_MATTRESS,BIKE_RACK,UNLIMITED_MILES",50.0,"US,US,US","San Bruno,Phoenix,Phoenix","37.6358200,33.5285300,33.5441100","-122.4228700,-112.0516500,-112.0483400"

Overview and Performance
The best selling and most popular electric vehicle in the world, the Tesla Model 3.  A luxurious minimalist and unique interior design and an all-glass roof. As with most EVs, the Model 3 gains speed smoothly and almost silently, with the electric motor providing strong power from a stop. And it's fast‚ÄîThe Standard Range Plus model sprints from zero to 60 mph in under 5 seconds. The steering is accurate and well weighted, with three different settings that adjust the level of steering effort. The ride is firm without being harsh; and quiet without the noise of a gas-powered engine.  But most drivers are more likely interested in driving range than speediness or handling, and the Model 3 delivers there too. 

Charging
Super charging only is available with this Model 3 (No Adapter Included).
Vehicle must be returned with the same charge level in which you received the vehicle.

Interior, Comfort, and Cargo
The Tesla Model 3 has an interior unlike any other car on the market today. It's shockingly simple inside, with nearly everything controlled by the monolithic 15"" touchscreen in the center of the dashboard. The Tesla's low, flat floor makes for a spacious and airy feel inside. The front seats are supportive and comfortable. Folding the 60/40 split-folding rear seats is simple and expands the trunk considerably. The Model 3's seatbacks fold flat, too, providing an uninterrupted cargo floor for hauling larger items. With the rear seats folded, the Model 3 provides enough room for 15 carry-on suitcases. There are also generously sized bins and cubbies throughout the cabin.

Infotainment and Connectivity
Navigation, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity are standard, as well as Several internet-streaming radio options are standard. To make charging-station layovers more bearable, the Model 3 offers plenty of entertainment options on its central display, including Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and a host of arcade games.

Safety and Driver-Assistance Features
The Model 3 has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and received a perfect five-star score; the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has named it a Top Safety Pick+.

Pile the whole family into the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan for a smooth ride, technology to keep everyone entertained, and an engine powerful enough to keep the driver entertained. The 2019 model received just a few minor changes, including an auto-dimming rearview mirror that is now standard. Here are some of the details for the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan. 

Engine
All three models come with a 3.6-liter V-6 engine. This powertrain will generate 283 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque, and it works with a six-speed automatic transmission and front wheel drive.

Performance
The V-6 in the Grand Caravan is one of the most powerful engines in its class. It easily gets the minivan up to speed for easy merging into traffic and then propels it smoothly down the highway. The suspension works to smooth out bumps in the road, providing a smooth cushioned ride for all its passengers. You can expect to get about 25 mpg on the highway, and if you need to bring a boat or camper on your family vacation, it can tow up to 3,600 pounds.",,,,,,,"COOLER,CHILD_SAFETY_SEAT,PREPAID_REFUEL,STROLLER",58.0,"US,US","Deerfield Beach,Kissimmee","26.3090600,28.3361400","-80.1127200,-81.6310900"

With a near-ideal blend of performance, driving range, and functionality, the Tesla Model 3 is an electric vehicle that lives up to the hype. It's quick as well as agile, which means the Model 3 is an EV that even driving enthusiasts can get behind. But for those looking to just sit back and have a relaxing drive, the Model 3 features a largely soundproof interior, tires and suspension geared towards better ride quality, and an entire suite of autonomous driving and advanced safety features thanks to Tesla's revolutionary Autopilot system. The Model 3 is an EV that aims to please all comers and succeeds at it.

A 5,412-pound (2,455-kg) SUV should not be able to do that, and yet the Model X Plaid is.

These are Tesla‚Äôs rates and any charges will be passed on to you.

¬´ Battery ¬ª
You do not need to charge the batteries up when you pick-up the vehicle. All efforts will be made to ensure you have at least 80% or greater battery capacity at the start of your trip.

¬´ Charging - Tesla Supercharger ¬ª
Tesla Superchargers offer the fastest charging and is free to use. The typical charging time is 40 minutes to get to 80% capacity. Borrowers are responsible for charging the vehicle before returning to a minimum of 30%

¬´ Range ¬ª
The estimated range for a fully charged battery in this vehicle is 225 Miles. Your mileage may vary. If you are going on a long trip, it is recommended to use the Model S‚Äôs on-board navigation system. The car will map out a route to your destination while factoring in Supercharging locations, distance, altitude, and your driving style to insure that you won't get stranded.

Note:
Super charging costs will be invoiced to you after your trip. As a reminder, make sure to immediately unplug after charging as you will be liable for idle fees of $1.00 per minute.

Being that Tesla's are 100% EV (electric vehicle, no gas) I recommend you familiarize yourself with how to operate the vehicle including how to locate and use charging stations. 
https://www.tesla.com/supercharger

See below FAQs and go to the Tesla website for information as well as search Google or YouTube to learn. Here's a link to several support videos you can watch on the Tesla website: https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos

You must keep the battery charged between 20% and 90% at all times.

FASTEST CHARGING:
ALWAYS seek TESLA SUPERCHARGER stations to charge the car as they are the FASTEST. Destination chargers are only useful if you have several hours to leave the car charging. To locate them click on Navigate on the main map screen and type in (or click mic and say): Tesla Superchargers.

1. Time to charge from 30% to 80%:
Tesla Supercharger will take about 30 minutes.
Destination charger will take about 6 hours.
2. To add about 100 miles of driving range:
Tesla Supercharger will take about 15 minutes.
Destination charger will take about 3 hours.

Tesla Supercharging is NOT FREE. Tesla bills at least $0.28/kwh. Guests will be billed post-trip for the charging costs. Additionally, Supercharger idle fees are up to $1.00/min if the car is plugged in and not actively charging. To AVOID IDLE FEES unplug and move the car within 5 minutes of it completing charge. *rates subject to change.

A J1772 charging adapter is included in the car for use at destination charging stations. Guest agrees to pay $125 to replace it if it's missing or damaged.

You can use the car's touchscreen or you may download various apps on your phone to help find the nearest J1772 destination charging stations near you:
1. Chargehub
2. Plugshare
3. ChargePoint
Some chargers are free, some require you to pay per use. These destination charging stations are located at: beaches, hotels, car dealerships, shopping centers, parking facilities, amusement parks, and more. *charge times vary.

Just like in a gasoline car, if you run the battery to 0% (empty), the vehicle will stop dead and you will be stranded and need to have it towed on a flatbed truck, at your expense, to a Tesla Supercharger. This could damage the battery or other components and you may be charged for repair/ replacement.

You must return it with between 70%-90% battery remaining, unless you purchased the Prepaid EV Recharge Extra, then you must return it with at least 20% battery.

As everyone's health and safety is of the utmost importance all of my vehicles go through a rigorous multi-step cleaning and disinfection process for each rental. 

BEWARE OF HOSTS with multiple CANCELLATIONS and NO SHOWS. My vehicle will be on time and ready for you as scheduled. Plus it will be clean in and out; freshly washed, vacuumed, wiped down, and disinfected when you receive it.

I am peer-to-peer car-sharing my personal vehicles that are lovingly driven often by my family, friends, and others. I am not operating a big rental car franchise with boring fleet cars. Please treat my cars kindly so they may continue to provide transportation for my family and others.

TO AVOID these miscellaneous fines/fees return the vehicle the same as when you received it. Stay within the included mileage, avoid tolls and tickets (if possible), return recharged to the correct level, make sure the vehicle is clean, on time, and smoke, odor, and damage free.

We love it. We are sure you will too!

Smooth ride, low center of gravity, fast acceleration, and don't forget, no toxic emissions!

Inside, you'll find a clean and simple dash with all the car's controls on the 15"" touchscreen. You also have front and rear heated seats, 18 speaker surround sound, and an amazing view through the glass roof.

You've probably filled up gas in a car before, but every you ever charged a car before? It's super easy! The car will come with 80-100% of charge already on it, which can take you up to 300 miles of range (based on your driving style). When you are low on juice, stop at a nearby Supercharger or Destination charger to put some juice back in the battery! Charge times can vary, however, a charge from 20% to 80% at a Supercharger generally takes 15-20 minutes. Fees for supercharging are generally cheaper than filling gas. We ask you return the car with at least 20% battery (60 miles). That probably means stopping at a Supercharger right before dropping it back off. Planning your trip around food, bathroom breaks, and staying at hotels with chargers can help you charge efficiently and save time!

Meet my beautiful Grey Falkor (named after the Neverending Story Luck Dragon).

A capable, refined crossover SUV with all the goodness of a minivan, save for the sliding doors. Three rows of seats and space for up to eight passengers, makes the Grey Falkor a most versatile vehicle. Even adults can fit in its third-row seat. The front seats are just about ideally shaped and with enough space to fit Jabba The Hut. It's an SUV that feels luxurious and mature behind the wheel. Use of space is very good with lots of storage. Practical features such as the easy-entry third row and flat load floor with the second and third rows lowered make a difference when hauling cargo and people.

An extremely utilitarian vehicle. Its large, well-thought-out interior proves extremely useful when you stuff it full of passengers or their gear. The fold-flat second and third row are extremely useful for big items, and there is generous storage under the rear load floor for extra luggage.

It also has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility with an 8-inch touchscreen for your entertainment cravings. Providing ample power and great handling, the Grey Falkor is among the athletes in the three-row SUV segment. It's a winner on mountain roads, easily gets up to speed.

The all-new 2022 Subaru BRZ takes a proven formula for designing and engineering a world class 2+2 sport coupe and ratchets everything up to entirely new levels. The exterior design is more muscular, purposeful and aerodynamic, a shape that‚Äôs guaranteed to stop traffic wherever it goes. The passenger cabin mirrors this approach, providing a driver-focused, technology-infused space that belongs both on the road and the racetrack. The iconic front engine/rear-wheel drive configuration is familiar, but here it‚Äôs placed in an all-new chassis that‚Äôs stronger than ever. The result is an even lower centre of gravity and near-perfect weight distribution, paired with new steering and sport-tuned suspension to create razor-sharp handling. Then there‚Äôs the all-new naturally aspirated 2.4L Subaru Boxer 4-cylinder, which puts more power, torque and sheer fun in the driver‚Äôs hands. Now more than ever, the Subaru BRZ is the 2+2 sport coupe purpose-built for the authentic driving enthusiast.

The spry handling, sharp steering, and capable boxer engine make the BRZ a great choice for drivers seeking excitement. The engine is paired with a six-speed manual transmission for outstanding engagement. The BRZ is a blast to take down winding roads.

****DELIVERY INFO****
I no longer offer deliveries as a normal part of my service. However, if you have a critical need, you can go ahead and book and message me and you can cancel with no penalty if I can't accommodate.
It was not too long ago that I booked my first car on Turo.  It was a great experience.  On Turo, you really can rent a great car (usually better than in any rental fleet) for half the price.  That's why I'm making my own car available to you now, too. 

Why should you hire my cars?
1. Great cars in great condition
2. Personal attention--I am not a rental car company--I am just a guy who loves cars!
3. Relatively generous mileage allowance
4. I don't expect you to wash the cars! Most other hosts do

I will strive to provide you with the same value and service that I was provided on my first Turo rental.  If this is your first time, just let me know and I'll put you at ease as best I can.

‚ö°Ô∏èTesla Supercharging is NOT FREE. Tesla bills at least $0.28/kWh. Guests will be billed post-trip for charging costs.

Just like in a gasoline car, if you run the battery to 0% (empty), the vehicle will stop dead and you will be stranded and need to have it towed on a flatbed truck, at your expense to a Tesla Supercharger. This could damage the battery or other components and you may be charged for repair/replacement.  

You must return it with 80%- 90% battery remaining, unless you purchased the prepaid EV Recharge Extra, then you must return it with at least 20% battery.

The easiest and quickest way to charge this vehicle is at one of Tesla‚Äôs 1000+ superchargers. It takes about 20-30mins for the vehicle to fully charge. Please do not allow vehicle to go below 15% charge during your trip. To avoid an idle fee, please do not remain at the supercharger station after charging session is complete. TESLA WILL CHARGE owners $1.00 for every minute that the vehicle is idling while fully charged.

This car is second to none and my absolute favorite car that I have ever owned. This Z06 Corvette has a jaw dropping yellow paint job with a sleek black interior to match. This Corvette has everything you could want in a rental. Aggressive wide body exterior, comfortable leather seats, a stereo to jam your favorite tunes, and a drop top for good weather. This car is absolutely stunning and a staple piece when it comes to American sports cars. This Z06 Corvette is powered by a 6.2L LT4 supercharged aluminum V8 delivering 650 horsepower and 650 lb. -ft. of torque. It uses a dry-sump oil system and titanium intake valves for reduced mass, along with sodium-filled exhaust valves for better heat dissipation along with a responsive 8-speed automatic transmission. This car will be the fastest on the road going 0-60mph in 2.9 seconds. But not only is this vehicle an incredible sports car, but it can ride like a dream in Eco/Touring mode getting 30 MPG! This Z06 CORVETTE is Rear-Wheel drive and it definitely gives the ride of a lifetime and is something everyone should experience! The Corvette is comfortable and feels like you‚Äôre in the inside of a rocket, so if you‚Äôre 6‚Äô5+ you may feel crammed. It offers plenty of trunk space perfect for luggage (you‚Äôll be surprise how much it offers). If you have ever wanted to experience a true american sports car, then you've found your vehicle, it is definitely a must and is one of a kind that you‚Äôll never forget.

This is a great new Santa Fe that has under 5000 miles on it.  The all-wheel drive makes it perfect for heading up to the mountains for a weekend getaway or even weeklong trip.  It's also great for driving along the front range and in the city.  Give it a try!

***Contactless Check-In/Check Out and Parking Fee*** 

We often do contactless check-in/out where you access the vehicle through a lock box.  When you return the vehicle, you will need to pay between $6.35 and $8.35 through the ParkMan App for the first 24 hours of lot parking.  Please DO NOT book this vehicle if you are not ok with this small parking fee!

***Getting Downtown is EASY*** It's not really any harder to get here to get a vehicle (via Uber/Lyft or the A-Line train) than to deal with the rental car shuttle and the lines there.  The rental car lots are about 15 minutes away from the airport terminal via shuttle, sometimes with multiple stops, as well as the wait to get the shuttle and the wait to get the car.  Also, downtown is more or less on the way to the mountains, if that's where you're headed.

*A-line train* 

The A-line train costs $10.50 per person (with discounts for some people) and leaves right from an area not far from baggage claim.  It runs every 15 minutes during the day and takes 37-44 minutes to get to Union Station, the last stop.

It is pretty easy to get to the key pick-up location from Union Station - you can take the free 16th Street Shuttle to Champa and walk 7 blocks to the key location, or you could grab a quick Uber/Lyft from Union Station to the key location. There's also the option of sending the primary driver ahead (either on the prior train or once you get to Union Station, and then having the primary driver go back for the others).

‚ö†Ô∏è I do not allow smoking in my car. This includes vaping, e-cigs, cigarettes, marijuana or any other type of smoking. I will request the maximum amount of cleaning if you leave any smoke and it will be an automatic 1 star rating.

 
‚úÖ This car gets maintained regularly and has regular oil changes. 

‚úÖ In order to use this car, Turo policy clearly states I have to check your drivers license üí≥. This is a contactless reservation which means you will need to upload a photo of you holding your license next to your face and another photo of just your license. Once I accept your reservation, you‚Äôll have an option in the Turo app to add photos and that is how you upload those photos for me. Failure to do this will result in your reservation being canceled without a refund. 

üö® Please do not be late to returning my car as I need time to clean üßº and disenfect for the next guest. 

‚è± If you would like to use the car longer, extend your trip in the Turo right away. It‚Äôs not guaranteed that I will be able to extend it. Making the request makes it faster to approve if I am able to extend it for you.

üöß If you are in an accident or have any problems with the car please do not try to repair the car yourself. Keep calm and Contact Turo immediately! Also message me to let me know your situation. 

‚õΩÔ∏è if you did not order a Fuel Extra Please return the car refueled to the same amount that you received it. If you do not refuel the car, I‚Äôm happy to refuel it for you. However there is an additional $10 convenience fee added to the cost of refueling for you. 

‚úàÔ∏è For Albuquerque airport deliveries, the car will be dropped off either at the garage or a location where you can get to it. I will not be able to know until I get it to the airport. I‚Äôll be able to let you know where it is either a few minutes before your trip start or after it starts. If it is in the garage, the garage requires us both to get an exit card. I will leave the exit card in the car with the key. You pay for the exit card, when you leave. When you return the card you will need to get an exit card and leave it for me in the car. I will pay for that exit card. The cost is $4 for one hour after the car is dropped off and no more than $12 for 24 hours. This is what the airport charges, not what I charge. I try to get the car delivered as close to your trip start time, but sometimes I may have to drop it off earlier or even the day before.

‚úàÔ∏è For Santa Fe airport deliveries: due to the car being located in Albuquerque, we charge an additional $200 that you will need to add as a trip one-way trip Extra in the Turo app in addition to the $120 Airport Drop off Fee. This car will be dropped off in the parking lot where you can get to it. I will not be able to know exactly where until I get it to the airport. I‚Äôll be able to let you know where it is either a few minutes before your trip start or after it starts. I will pay for the parking fee (Currently $3) when I drop off the car and you‚Äôll be responsible for paying the parking fee when you drop off the car. You‚Äôll see pay stations throught the airport and will need to get a card and place it on the dashboard. If you don‚Äôt and the car gets towed, you‚Äôll be responsible for the towing fees. I can usually drop off the car in Santa Fe the same day as long as long as you are willing for it to get delivered. I am very good and reliable about getting my cars to my guests. All I ask is for is a little time and patience :) 

If anything else changes I will let you know in a message. If you agree to everything, please send me a request. If you have questions, send me a request or text me a question).

1. Yes the car is available to rent if you put in your dates and times you want the car and it shows available. It will tell you if the car is not available with your desired pick up and drop off times. 

2. Yes I can deliver the car to the airport or your location for a fee which will show you in the delivery section when you follow the booking steps. 

3. In order to see what the total price will be please follow the check out process with your dates and times picked up. I can‚Äôt see all the Turo fees that are charged so please don‚Äôt ask what the total cost will be. 

4. Any other questions are great!

You will receive the car super clean and sanitized. All I ask is that you return the car in the same condition as you received it. 99% of renters wash it and vacuum it out before returning it and I highly recommend that to avoid any cleaning fees just to be safe.  If I have to end up washing the car inside and out after your trip then all I ask is you reimburse me for it.  If you run out of time to wash it before returning the car I totally understand. It happens more than you think. Just communicate with me and I don‚Äôt have a problem washing and cleaning the car after your trip.

Looking for a reliable AWD ride, that gets great gas mileage and will keep you and your family safe wherever your Colorado adventure takes you? Look no further. 

This Subaru Outback is safe, reliable, and ready for your Colorado adventure. It‚Äôs a comfortable ride that will get you anywhere you need to go, in whatever weather conditions Colorado might throw at you on your trip. 

Most importantly, this vehicle will keep you and your family safe during your trip. All my vehicles will be deep cleaned and sanitized between customers to prevent the spread of germs during this flu season. Every car and key is sanitized and cleaned thoroughly with anti-bacterial cleaning products before and after each trip. You will be driving one of the cleanest cars in the Denver area. 

Worried about the snow? Hate putting on snow chains? This AWD Outback is equipped with Blizzak snow tires, so you NEVER have to stop and put on chains or worry about getting stuck in the snow! It is Colorado law that cars have chains or snow tires, don't waste your time renting a vehicle without snow tires. The Outback is extremely reliable and safe in all weather conditions. (Blizzak snow tires will be on the vehicle from October-April)

Breeze pass the tolls with the toll pass in the vehicle. (You will be billed at a later date for all toll charges incurred during your trip).

If you are worried about space, I am 6'3"" and fit comfortably in the front and back seat. 

Plenty of storage in the back of the Outback to fit all your luggage and gear for your Colorado adventures. 

Worried about not having enough space for all your luggage or gear? Consider adding my Thule Motion XT XL roof top storage box, with 18 cubic feet of storage, to the roof of the Outback. This box can fit multiple sets of skis or snowboards inside, along with boots and whatever other gear you plan to bring on your trip. (Max ski length for rooftop box is 200cm.) The Thule Box is listed as ""luggage rack"" in extras. (Refer to photos for pictures of the roof top box). If the rooftop storage box is not added as an extra, the box will not be on the vehicle for your trip. 

**Thule rooftop storage box is not included for free and must be added as an extra** 

Your vehicle will be waiting for you upon arrival at your requested pickup location, including Denver International Airport (DIA). Vehicle is parked in Longmont, but can be dropped off to anywhere in the Denver metro area at your request. 

The vehicle has Android Auto, Apple Car Play, and Bluetooth. Sirius XM radio is included in the car for free as well. 

I would be glad to help out with any questions you might have about Denver and the surrounding areas. 

I want to help make your trip to the Mile High City as stress free and enjoyable as possible! 

You will receive the car with a full tank of gas. Please drop the car off with a full tank of gas or save time by purchasing my prepaid fuel option and you don't have to stress about filling up the car at drop off. 

The car will be nice and clean when you arrive, please return the car clean, within reason. (Don't worry about the salt and dirt from the roads, that is to be expected if heading up to the mountains)

Although the Tiguan has been on sale for six years without a major redesign, there's still a lot to be said for VW's compact crossover SUV. If you're looking for a small utility vehicle that doesn't feel entry-level and you're willing to spend a little extra, the Tiguan remains one of the most rewarding vehicles in its segment.

On the road, the Tiguan's suspension and powertrain continue to set it apart. The ride is quiet and smooth, even on patchy roads, yet there's enough athleticism here to keep the tall VW planted in corners. And while the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is less powerful than the engines in some rival crossovers, it feels as energetic as ever in real-world acceleration. If compact crossovers were judged solely on driving satisfaction, the Tiguan would be a perennial all-star.

But there's a more practical side to crossover ownership, of course, and that's where the Tiguan comes back to earth. Take technology features, for example. Happily, Bluetooth now comes standard on every Tiguan, and if you step up from the base S to the SE, you get iPod connectivity and VW's new Car-Net safety telematics system, too. But the SE's retail price is higher than the norm, especially if you want the touchscreen interface that comes with the Appearance package. Plus, no matter the model, the Tiguan has less luggage and cargo space than most competitors.

If you're looking for Tiguan alternatives, the biggest challenge is narrowing them down to a manageable group. We're big fans of the stylish and fuel-efficient 2014 Mazda CX-5, while the 2014 Ford Escape delivers Tiguan-style European driving dynamics in a considerably higher-tech package. We'd also take a look at the turbocharged Kia Sportage SX as a quicker, edgier and potentially cheaper substitute. On the higher end, you could look at a premium-brand model like the BMW X1, which offers a level of performance rarely found in a crossover, although, it offers no more space than the VW and option prices are higher. Ultimately, if the 2014 Volkswagen Tiguan's sophisticated character speaks to you, don't let ageism hold you back. Asking price aside, it's still one of the most appealing compact crossovers you can buy.",,,,,,,"SNORKELING_GEAR,CAMPING_GEAR,UNLIMITED_MILES,UNLIMITED_MILES,BEACH_GEAR,COOLER,CAMPING_GEAR,CHILD_SAFETY_SEAT,UNLIMITED_MILES",54.0,CA,Calgary,51.0908000,-114.0598800

After having driven multiple cars throughout my lifetime, nothing beats the comfort of driving a tesla. With the convenience of it being electric, no need for paying for gas especially during these times with the high rising gas prices. This car is dual motor, all wheel drive, self driving and has a battery capable of charging to 360 miles. (All black interior) The car reacts as fast as you want it to when driving which really helps with getting through traffic. After 9pm electricity prices drop which makes it about 14 dollars to fully charge this Tesla from anything lower than 20 percent battery if you take it to a supercharger. Which beats paying 65 dollars to fill up the tank on my Honda. The car is also self driving if you don‚Äôt feel like driving in heavy traffic or in case you just want to sit back and relax.

If you are going to cities like Queretaro, Guanajuato, Celaya, San Miguel de Allende or the like, this car is a good option since it is located practically on the highway that takes you to those cities. 

If you want to avoid driving in the worst part of the traffic of Mexico City when your flight arrives/departs. You can take an UBER to my location or vice versa ($10-15 USD) and then you are done. I¬¥m flexible with the conditions. 
If it looks that the location is not that convenient (in terms of the airport), maybe it happens when you just arrive at the airport because you want to have a car asap and be free. In contrast, when you are leaving it can be a nightmare, specially because you have to drop the car and you have to drive in the middle of the traffic, trust me, even the locals avoid it. If you ask me, it is better to drop the car in a good and convenient location of the city, and then going by Uber or Taxi to the airport, it is not your problem anymore. Sometimes those kind of things do not have price. 
My neighborhood is safe and convenient for travelling. 

The car has GPS.

Minivans are undeniably versatile vehicles for growing families. They offer a pleasant ride, easy maneuverability, respectable gas mileage and, most important, room for children and all the stuff that comes with them. The 2012 Mazda 5 is unique among minivans, as it has remained relatively small and only has six seats. If you don't need the seventh seat and added space in other minivans, the Mazda 5 still offers quite a bit of utility.

In spite of its smaller dimensions, the Mazda 5 has most of the typical minivan conveniences. It lightweight sliding doors provide make it simple to get kids in and out of the second row, and there are plenty of useful storage compartments. The Mazda also has something that most minivans don't: a certain level of fun. Not only is the smaller 5 easier to manage in crowded cities than larger minivans, its relatively sporty suspension and steering make it genuinely fun to drive, even if you're just going to the grocery store.",,,,,,,,30.0,US,Honolulu,21.2927600,-157.8190000

The car will be cleaned and sanitised before every trip and is regularly maintained to ensure an enjoyable drive every time.

It's also conveniently setup with both congestion zone and dart-charge auto pay - if you happen to enter either zone, we will automatically be charged and will simply add the charge to your trip. (Meaning no surprise fines for you!). It is also ULEZ free. Any additional parking fines, tickets or charges will be forwarded to you for payment.

For fuel, the car takes diesel. It will usually be full at the start of your rental, so you just need to refuel before returning it.

There are several upgrades to note with this Slingshot - the roof, windshield, and side wind deflectors will buffer the wind significantly, meaning you will get a much more comfortable ride than you otherwise would in a Slingshot not equipped with those options.

The upgraded audio system sounds great, adjusts volume with your speed automatically, and connects to your phone wirelessly.

Other Notes;

- The Slingshot is well taken care of and is cleaned inside and out before each rental; if I can't clean it, I won't rent it! 

- Only personal (IL Class D or equivalent) drivers license needed to drive

- I am 6'4"" and have comfortably driven it for about 6 hours in one day

- If picking up from my home, you are welcome to park your personal vehicle in my secure garage during your rental period

- What happens if it rains? Everything is waterproof! From the radio to instruments; There are even drain holes in the floor that let the water out.

- Please note per IL law, glasses are required while driving (any type of eyewear suffices)

Honda's popular Civic compact car gets a¬†big glow-up for the 2022 model year¬†as it debuts a more grown-up appearance, new features, and a refined cabin design. The improvements and more helped it earn a spot on¬†our Editors' Choice list. A selection of four-cylinder engines‚Äîincluding a turbocharged 1.5-liter‚Äîare offered; front-wheel drive will continue to be standard as Honda insists all-wheel drive is not part of the plan. Updated tech features such as a larger infotainment display, wireless smartphone connectivity, and improved¬†driver-assistance features¬†are all meaningful updates that will help the Civic stave off competition from the likes of the¬†Hyundai Elantra, the¬†Mazda 3, and the¬†Toyota Corolla.

What's New for 2022?

The Civic is all-new for 2022, with a redesigned body and an updated interior. Like the last generation model, the 2022 Civic will be offered in both¬†sedan¬†and¬†hatchback¬†body styles.

0$10k$20k$30k$40k$50k

Our recommendation is the well-equipped EX trim on the sedan model, which comes with a lot of additional features that easily justify the increase in price. Those niceties include blind-spot monitoring, a power sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated exterior mirrors, and heated front seats. It also comes standard with the more powerful 180-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine. If you're buying the hatchback, we'd direct you to the EX-L, which offers similar equipment and adds leather upholstery.

Engine, Transmission, and Performance

Even though it has redesigned everything else about the new Civic, Honda has decided to carry over the powertrain options from the previous-generation car. Base models come standard with a 158-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder while the upgrade engine continues to be a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that now makes 180 horsepower. The new Civic is offered solely with front-wheel-drive car. Sadly, the manual transmission offered on the previous generation Civic sedan has been cut for 2022, leaving a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) as the sole offering; a six-speed manual is still available on the hatchback model. At our test track, our turbocharged Touring sedan needed¬†7.5 seconds to reach 60 mph, which is slightly slower than the last generation Civic's result. The manual¬†Sport Touring hatchback we tested¬†did slightly better at 7.3 seconds to 60 mph. Luckily, the spry handling, communicative steering, and well-balanced ride that we appreciated so much in the last generation model are present and accounted for here.¬†Sporty Si¬†and¬†high-performance Type-R¬†variants are also in the works and both will offer a manual transmission; we review those models separately.

Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG

According to the EPA, the most fuel efficient version of the new Civic is the mid-range EX, which earns ratings of 33 mpg city, 42 mpg highway, and 36 mpg combined. When we get a chance, we'll take the 2022 Civic on our¬†75-mph highway fuel-economy route¬†and report its results here. For more information about the Civic's fuel economy, visit the¬†EPA's website.

Interior, Comfort, and Cargo

A more streamlined interior design debuts in the 2022 Civic, with cleaner lines and a dashboard featuring a full-width honeycomb-patterned mesh design element that cleverly hides the air vents. A wider center console appears less cluttered than the outgoing model's and features what looks like a large, deep bin ahead of the shift lever for stashing smartphones, keys, and road-trip snacks. Honda says passenger space is roughly the same is also offered and its cargo bay is more generous.

Infotainment and Connectivity

The 2022 Civic will come standard with a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment display, but a larger 9.0-inch unit is optional, as is a 10.2-inch digital gauge display. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard and also offer wireless connectivity when paired with the larger of the two screens. Other options include in-dash navigation, a Bose stereo system, and a wireless smartphone charging pad.

Safety and Driver-Assistance Features

A host of¬†driver-assistance features¬†will be offered as standard, including automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection and an adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping assist. For more information about the Civic's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:

Standard automated emergency braking

Standard lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist

Standard adaptive cruise control

Warranty and Maintenance Coverage

Honda's standard warranty package is merely average, with rivals such as the Elantra and¬†Kia Forte¬†offering more comprehensive coverage. Buyers of the Civic also won't find any complimentary scheduled maintenance plan, something the Corolla offers as standard.

Limited warranty covers three years or 36,000 miles

Powertrain warranty covers five years or 60,000 miles

Some of the car's features include an auto-pilot to make your life easier on the highway; a great navigation system; a charging map on the large display; front and back cameras; video games and an entertainment center.

The car has 18K miles and can be charged for less than 30 minutes in any Tesla Supercharger station. It will run up to 200 miles before you'll need to recharge it. The car comes with a charger, so if you want to charge it at home or office, you can connect to any 120V outlet. Note that this will take a much longer time to charge.

Currently, the car can be picked up and dropped off at 1030 Race st., Philadelphia 19107. If you need some assistance with learning how to operate the vehicle, call me any time.

Safe trips!

Thank you for visiting another one of AutoNation Honda Valencia's online listings! Please continue for more information on this 2013 Toyota Venza Limited with 107,020mi. Drive home in your new pre-owned vehicle with the knowledge you're fully backed by the CARFAX Buyback Guarantee. Hit the gas pedal and put the engine power to all four wheels. With AWD, you'll have the greater performance right off the line, every time you drive. A Toyota with as few miles as this one is a rare find. This Venza Limited was gently driven and it shows. Added comfort with contemporary style is the leather interior to heighten the quality and craftsmanship for the Toyota Venza Limited. More information about the 2013 Toyota Venza: The Venza starts at under $28,000, offering a lot of space and utility for the money. However, the vehicle can be optioned up fairly substantially for those wanting a bigger dose of luxury and increased utility. Prices eventually top out at around $38,000 for a fully loaded V6 version with all-wheel drive. The Venza's main trick, is offering up the space and utility of an SUV without the compromised handling and fuel economy that would accompany such a vehicle. Strengths of this model include comfortable, versatile, Spacious, and available all-wheel-drive.

We look to provide a ""Mile High Experience"" to those traveling in the MILE HIGH STATE!

Now for the GOOD STUFF!!! If you're bringing back a legendary nameplate after a quarter-century slumber -- particularly one tasked with dethroning the industry's biggest icon -- you've gotta give it everything you've got.

From the moment the final Ford Bronco left the factory back in 1996, there have been embers of hope for a revival, but it's taken 25 years to get a new model into dealers. Along the way, there have been countless secret meetings, design studies, business proposals, false starts and pandemic-induced delays. Regardless, today, Ford has more than 125,000 firm orders booked for its new SUV and the model has earned more consumer buzz than any of the brand's new vehicles in decades. In other words, it might've all been worth it.

It would've been easy for Ford to copy the 4x4 formula long adhered to by the Wrangler and various other hardcore SUVs that have come and gone -- including Ford's original 1966 Bronco. That stone-tablet blueprint calls for simple body-on-frame construction, solid axles front and rear, a removable roof and doors, and recirculating-ball steering.

Indeed, the 2021 Bronco has a separate body and ladder-style truck chassis, as well as a removable roof and doors. However, Ford decided to go with an independent front suspension and rack-and-pinion steering. Both of these technologies are known for better control, precision and refinement, albeit at a higher cost and with relative question marks around durability (and, in the case of IFS, ultimate off-road wheel articulation).

Those aforementioned passengers should be a bit comfier in the Bronco, too, especially when you compare two-door models. The two-door rides on a significantly longer wheelbase than the Jeep, which makes for improved rear-seat access and seating comfort. You needn't be in the second row to feel like you're in a better place, however, as the interior feels substantially less claustrophobic. Even the entry-level Bronco's cabin plainly shames the Wrangler's older, more basic furnishings. The same can be said in terms of tech, where the Bronco's base 8-inch Sync 4 touchscreen is nearly the same size as the Jeep's optional 8.4-inch Uconnect display, and Ford offers a massive
12-inch display that's even better. The latter isn't just preferable for playing music on the
available 10-speaker B&O audio system, it actually helps make off-roading easier. The Ford's available forward-facing and 360-degree bird's-eye camera coverage acts like a digital spotter to help make life on the trail much easier. You can use the cameras to place tires over obstacles with confidence, as well as see ahead when positioned nose up or nose down on steep hills.

Those generous screens will also make it easier to take advantage of the Bronco's new FordPass Performance App and its off-road navigation abilities. This smartphone-based software helps find new trails with topographic maps, as well as capture and share directions and video with fellow off-roaders on the fly. Out in the sticks, connectivity can be rough, so thankfully you can download the maps for use when wanderlust exceeds your mobility provider's best efforts.

Despite the presence of a big screen and loads of tech, the Bronco's cabin has a welcome function-over-form aesthetic. The dashboard is a simple rectangular block, bookended by a pair of hefty (but removable) grab handles, while the door panels are skinned simply and devoid of switchgear to facilitate easy removal (the window and side-mirror switches are mounted below the center armrest). One other nice bit of news? The 10-speed automatic shifter is a beefy lever with a distinctly old-school, mechanical action. Ford resisted the urge to install the electronic rotary dial PRNDL puck it's been fitting to other models. While more space efficient, the latter would have felt too dainty for a rig like this.

There are a raft of other clever touches, including a mounting point on the dashboard's top-dead-center for brought-in devices like GoPros and off-road navigation units, and

you'll find USB-A and USB-C power points atop the dash, too. Rear seats can be fitted with Molle system straps for securing extra gear and you can even opt for water-resistant marine-grade vinyl seats and rubberized flooring with drain plugs for easy cleanup.

Whether you want a two- or a four-door Bronco, there's a meaningful cargo space edge over the Jeep. Two-door hardtop models vary from 22.4 cubic feet to 52.3 with the back seats folded. That may not sound like much, but the equivalent Wrangler has just 12.9 and 31.7, respectively. That's a massive quality-of-life difference. The four-door Ford's advantage is less gaping, but it's still real. It ranges from 35.6 cubes to 77.6 with the rear seats down, besting Jeep's 31.7 and 72.4.

We look to provide a ""Mile High Experience"" to those traveling in the MILE HIGH STATE!

Now for the GOOD STUFF!!! If you're bringing back a legendary nameplate after a quarter-century slumber -- particularly one tasked with dethroning the industry's biggest icon -- you've gotta give it everything you've got.

From the moment the final Ford Bronco left the factory back in 1996, there have been embers of hope for a revival, but it's taken 25 years to get a new model into dealers. Along the way, there have been countless secret meetings, design studies, business proposals, false starts and pandemic-induced delays. Regardless, today, Ford has more than 125,000 firm orders booked for its new SUV and the model has earned more consumer buzz than any of the brand's new vehicles in decades. In other words, it might've all been worth it.

It would've been easy for Ford to copy the 4x4 formula long adhered to by the Wrangler and various other hardcore SUVs that have come and gone -- including Ford's original 1966 Bronco. That stone-tablet blueprint calls for simple body-on-frame construction, solid axles front and rear, a removable roof and doors, and recirculating-ball steering.

Indeed, the 2021 Bronco has a separate body and ladder-style truck chassis, as well as a removable roof and doors. However, Ford decided to go with an independent front suspension and rack-and-pinion steering. Both of these technologies are known for better control, precision and refinement, albeit at a higher cost and with relative question marks around durability (and, in the case of IFS, ultimate off-road wheel articulation).

Those aforementioned passengers should be a bit comfier in the Bronco, too, especially when you compare two-door models. The two-door rides on a significantly longer wheelbase than the Jeep, which makes for improved rear-seat access and seating comfort. You needn't be in the second row to feel like you're in a better place, however, as the interior feels substantially less claustrophobic. Even the entry-level Bronco's cabin plainly shames the Wrangler's older, more basic furnishings. The same can be said in terms of tech, where the Bronco's base 8-inch Sync 4 touchscreen is nearly the same size as the Jeep's optional 8.4-inch Uconnect display, and Ford offers a massive
12-inch display that's even better. The latter isn't just preferable for playing music on the
available 10-speaker B&O audio system, it actually helps make off-roading easier. The Ford's available forward-facing and 360-degree bird's-eye camera coverage acts like a digital spotter to help make life on the trail much easier. You can use the cameras to place tires over obstacles with confidence, as well as see ahead when positioned nose up or nose down on steep hills.

Those generous screens will also make it easier to take advantage of the Bronco's new FordPass Performance App and its off-road navigation abilities. This smartphone-based software helps find new trails with topographic maps, as well as capture and share directions and video with fellow off-roaders on the fly. Out in the sticks, connectivity can be rough, so thankfully you can download the maps for use when wanderlust exceeds your mobility provider's best efforts.

Despite the presence of a big screen and loads of tech, the Bronco's cabin has a welcome function-over-form aesthetic. The dashboard is a simple rectangular block, bookended by a pair of hefty (but removable) grab handles, while the door panels are skinned simply and devoid of switchgear to facilitate easy removal (the window and side-mirror switches are mounted below the center armrest). One other nice bit of news? The 10-speed automatic shifter is a beefy lever with a distinctly old-school, mechanical action. Ford resisted the urge to install the electronic rotary dial PRNDL puck it's been fitting to other models. While more space efficient, the latter would have felt too dainty for a rig like this.

There are a raft of other clever touches, including a mounting point on the dashboard's top-dead-center for brought-in devices like GoPros and off-road navigation units, and

you'll find USB-A and USB-C power points atop the dash, too. Rear seats can be fitted with Molle system straps for securing extra gear and you can even opt for water-resistant marine-grade vinyl seats and rubberized flooring with drain plugs for easy cleanup.

Whether you want a two- or a four-door Bronco, there's a meaningful cargo space edge over the Jeep. Two-door hardtop models vary from 22.4 cubic feet to 52.3 with the back seats folded. That may not sound like much, but the equivalent Wrangler has just 12.9 and 31.7, respectively. That's a massive quality-of-life difference. The four-door Ford's advantage is less gaping, but it's still real. It ranges from 35.6 cubes to 77.6 with the rear seats down, besting Jeep's 31.7 and 72.4.

‚úàÔ∏è I will deliver to Orlando Airport 

ü§ë FREE DELIVERY (sort of) to MCO Orlando Airport for trips 7 days or longer*

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT AIRPORT DELIVERY

The first thing to understand is that even if a host offers free delivery, the airport themselves and also Turo are both going to charge you a bunch of fees for doing business at the airport. This is a legal contract MCO airport and Turo have and the hosts can‚Äôt control it

Also MCO Orlando airport has currently closed the terminal parking garages and they are not allowing anyone to park there. This means the car would be parked in the economy lot and you will need to take the airport shuttle about 10 minutes away to the lot to get the car.

So to make it much cheaper and convenient for you, the best bet is to choose ‚ÄúCAR LOCATION‚Äù when booking (and do not choose airport delivery). 

This car location is only 2 miles from the airport. Taking an Uber there will be much more convenient and easy than the airport shuttle. And you will not have to pay all those fees Turo and MCO will charge you ü§ó 

TIP: you can play around with the settings and selections before confirming your booking, and look at the price it shows you for airport delivery versus car location, and you‚Äôll see how much Turo is charging you ‚Äî even when the host does not)

And if your trip is 7 days or longer, I will even pay for your Uber üôå 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚öôÔ∏è MILES: 200 miles per day are included. If you go over that, you‚Äôll be charged by the mile upon return. 

üóì‚è± SHORT-NOTICE BOOKING INFO: we have the default settings on Turo where it requires at least one day advance notice‚Ä¶ Buuuuuuut I want you to know, if you need to book it on short notice, same day, or next day... we are usually pretty flexible‚Ä¶ So just text us first and we‚Äôll see if we can work something out for you and make it available for short-notice booking üëä 

‚ÄºÔ∏è Please note that in order to do CONTACTLESS CHECKIN and to allow for a few days between trips for coronavirus precautions... the car will spend a few days outside in an uncovered lot, so the outside may be dirty with water spots from rain or dirt or pollen when you get to it, but the interiors will be very clean. DO NOT BOOK if the exterior being dirty will cause you to be upset and leave me a bad review. Prices are SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED to compensate for these few things beyond my control at this time and for us to ensure proper covid precautions 


Please help me out by keeping the following in mind: 

‚úÖ Treat the Alfa as if it were your own

‚úÖ Fill up the tank before returning 

‚úÖ Keep it clean for me and the next renter

‚úÖ Absolutely no smoking, vaping or eating in the car (I don‚Äôt play with this, you WILL be charged $150 if you smoke in my cars)

‚úÖ HAVE FUN!

 Take the doors off and cruise through the small towns and back roads of North Georgia in a 2001 Turbo Diesel HMMWV!  
Take it cruising, camping, or use it for videos and social media.  Wherever you go, you will turn heads!  It has a 6.5 Turbo Diesel, 4 speed transmission, and black interior.  
 It can be rented with hard or half soft doors. We HIGHLY recommend NO doors on a nice warm clear day.  The truck has NO AC, so a breeze is the best way to travel. 
 This HMMWV is NOT fast. Yes it's bumpy, yes it's loud...but it's also an experience that most people will never have.

This is a very low mileage, near-mint Audi Q7 Premium Plus Quattro with a Supercharged V6 motor. I had been receiving requests for a 3rd Row Passenger vehicle that wasn‚Äôt a van and did not want to disappoint. This Q7 allows you to travel in style with power under your foot as well !! 

My AWD Q7 comes equipped with nearly everything under the sun: Heated & Cooled Leather Seats, Panoramic Sunroof, Navigation, Bluetooth, Rear A/C & Heater controls, Electric 3rd Row Seating, Heads-Up Display that comes out of dashboard, LED Interior/Exterior Lighting, Cruise Control, Lane Assist, Multiple Driving Modes, Rear Window Sun visors, and much more !!

The 2nd Row seats can be moved forward and back to create more leg room for either the 2nd or 3rd row passengers. The 2nd row can also be flipped up to allow endless leg room from the Rear Sears. Average size adults can fit comfortably in the 3rd row with passengers on the 2nd.  The seats can be raised up and lowered  back into place with the push of a button. Room and comfort will never be an issue in this Audi !!

This is a very low mileage vehicle that is under a warranty which states that I must have all maintenance done by the set intervals or else I void warranty. Therefore you can feel safe knowing the vehicle is always maintained properly. 

I am a professional Detailer and my vehicles are always delivered CLEAN !!

I am open to trips of any length, whether it be a day or several months. Delivery is available at additional cost and Airport deliveries are available at any time or day.  Bookings in advance qualify for Early Bird Discounts as do trips of 3 days or more. 

I can provide a video of how to have the 3rd row seat come up with the push of a button. It can comfortably seat an average size adult with the 2nd row also kicked back for adults.  This vehicle is deceptively roomy !!

I take a lot of pride in providing people with clean, sanitary vehicles. Therefore, smoking/vaping and/or pets are not allowed under any circumstances, medical or not. 

There will be a ($250/smoking and/or $100/pet) fine applied if any evidence of either is found. While I do want everyone to enjoy their experience, I also carry the responsibility of providing a fresh vehicle to the next Guest. 

I try to be as transparent as possible so that everyone can relax without any questions during their trip.

I can always be reached via Turo Messenger or Text when questions or issues arise.

But if your flight change schedule, please let me know as soon as possible, because I take the train to the airport and it normally takes 1 hour to 1 and a half hour. It will be hard to come early or later to match your schedule immediately. 

The car DOES NOT have iPass toll device but the license plate of this car was registered to Illinois toll, so feel free to go through any electric IPASS lane, I will send the bill to you after a few weeks. Please don‚Äôt use your own iPass or pay online at home because they will still charge my account. It is the problem which we have not had any solution yet. But with other tolls like EZ toll or Chicago Skyway, etc, you will need to pay yourself. 

In case, I can‚Äôt deliver the car or pickup in time due to some reason (traffic, changing schedule, etc), we can park the car inside the airport parking then leave the key, ticket and take the photo of where we park so we can find it easily.

If I don‚Äôt reply your message, please call:

Drive home in your new pre-owned vehicle with the knowledge you're fully backed by the CARFAX Buyback Guarantee. Hit the gas pedal and put the engine power to all four wheels. With AWD, you'll have the greater performance right off the line, every time you drive. A Toyota with as few miles as this one is a rare find. This Venza Limited was gently driven and it shows. Added comfort with contemporary style is the leather interior to heighten the quality and craftsmanship for the Toyota Venza Limited. More information about the 2013 Toyota Venza: The Venza starts at under $28,000, offering a lot of space and utility for the money. However, the vehicle can be optioned up fairly substantially for those wanting a bigger dose of luxury and increased utility. Prices eventually top out at around $38,000 for a fully loaded V6 version with all-wheel drive. The Venza's main trick, is offering up the space and utility of an SUV without the compromised handling and fuel economy that would accompany such a vehicle. Strengths of this model include comfortable, versatile, Spacious, and available all-wheel-drive.

Whereas previous Civic Coupes were little more than Civic Sedans with fewer doors, the new Coupe is a shorter, sportier alternative to the more staid sedan. Already lower and leaner than the sedan, the Civic Coupe also sports increased damper stiffness, firmer spring rates, and unique stabilizer bars to go with the noticeably more aggressive styling. As is the case with the sedan, there are currently two engine options for the Civic Coupe. Our Civic Coupe LX tester sports the base 2.0-liter I-4 making 158 hp and 138 lb-ft of torque mated to a six-speed manual. A CVT is optional. The ""big"" engine is actually quite little, a 1.5-liter, turbocharged I-4. The turbocharged mill‚Äîa first for the Honda brand in the U.S. since the CX500 Turbo motorcycle in the early '80s‚Äîproduces 174 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque. A CVT is currently the only available transmission on the turbo-four, though a six-speed manual will soon be added to the lineup
