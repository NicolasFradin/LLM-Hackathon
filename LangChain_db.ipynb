      " Task decomposition refers to breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subtasks. In AI systems like HuggingGPT, it involves parsing user requests into multiple tasks with attributes such as type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. This process can be guided by few-shot examples or human inputs. Expert models execute on the individual tasks and log results for further processing. Challenges in long-term planning and effective exploration of solution spaces remain a significant obstacle due to limited context length and LLMs' less robustness compared to humans when faced with unexpected errors. Model selection involves presenting LLM with a list of models based on the request type, and task execution involves executing individual tasks using expert models while keeping track of resource dependencies. \n"
